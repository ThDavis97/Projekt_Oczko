For advanced users only.

The \doxyref{sb\+SEND\+\_\+\+COMPLETED()}{p.}{stream__buffer_8c_aa75273dfbcd92710254df0165ae1da5d} macro is called from within the Free\+RTOS APIs when data is sent to a message buffer or stream buffer. If there was a task that was blocked on the message or stream buffer waiting for data to arrive then the \doxyref{sb\+SEND\+\_\+\+COMPLETED()}{p.}{stream__buffer_8c_aa75273dfbcd92710254df0165ae1da5d} macro sends a notification to the task to remove it from the Blocked state. \doxyref{x\+Message\+Buffer\+Send\+Completed\+From\+ISR()}{p.}{message__buffer_8h_a45918d12bf530cb2b4bf21c0936460a9} does the same thing. It is provided to enable application writers to implement their own version of \doxyref{sb\+SEND\+\_\+\+COMPLETED()}{p.}{stream__buffer_8c_aa75273dfbcd92710254df0165ae1da5d}, and MUST NOT BE USED AT ANY OTHER TIME.

See the example implemented in Free\+RTOS/\+Demo/\+Minimal/\+Message\+Buffer\+AMP.\+c for additional information.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em x\+Stream\+Buffer} & The handle of the stream buffer to which data was written.\\
\hline
{\em px\+Higher\+Priority\+Task\+Woken} & $\ast$px\+Higher\+Priority\+Task\+Woken should be initialised to pd\+FALSE before it is passed into \doxyref{x\+Message\+Buffer\+Send\+Completed\+From\+ISR()}{p.}{message__buffer_8h_a45918d12bf530cb2b4bf21c0936460a9}. If calling \doxyref{x\+Message\+Buffer\+Send\+Completed\+From\+ISR()}{p.}{message__buffer_8h_a45918d12bf530cb2b4bf21c0936460a9} removes a task from the Blocked state, and the task has a priority above the priority of the currently running task, then $\ast$px\+Higher\+Priority\+Task\+Woken will get set to pd\+TRUE indicating that a context switch should be performed before exiting the ISR.\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
If a task was removed from the Blocked state then pd\+TRUE is returned. Otherwise pd\+FALSE is returned. 
\end{DoxyReturn}
